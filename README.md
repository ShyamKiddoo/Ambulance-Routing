# Ambulance-Routing
To provide the information about the various Accident-prone zones and also the nearby Hospitals and the shortest distance graph to reach the nearby hospital from the Accident Zone using Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path calculation and HTML for graph representation(front-end)

Nowadays, there is a huge surge in the increase of road accidents. Thus, in order to ensure that the ambulance arrival is within the targeted time, ambulance availability must be ensured and the Optimal route that would provide the shortest distance to a nearby hospital must be determined.  Thus, an interface is developed to help the ambulance providers in sending the ambulance to a specified location. The interface for the ambulance routing is designed to give shortest path and shortest distance

Input
The list of hospitals which are nearby to the accident zone and the distance between them.

Output
The application would output the nearest Hospital from a particular place so that the ambulance would reach the hospital in a short time.
